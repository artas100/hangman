# Hangman 


This is a console program I made to practice python.

# Here you can:
<!-- Italics -->
    *Choose difficulty*
    *Will have different amount of trials depending on difficulty*
    *Interface with words written and words failed*
   * Will be able to repeat*
 
## To get started, you just need to run:

py main.py
